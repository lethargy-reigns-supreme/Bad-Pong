# Bad-Pong
A bad and unoptimized version of Pong with an extra paddle in the middle for fun

If you see this, please tell me what I could do to make it better. There were a bug that I didn't fix. When the Ball reappears in the middle, and the center paddle is inside of it, it kind of freaks out and looks weird.
